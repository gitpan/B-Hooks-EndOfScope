  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.27 to stop exceptions thrown in on_scope_end
    blocks from segfaulting. Also add a test for that.

  * Use Variable::Magic and cast %^H instead Scope::Guard and relying
    on a timely destruction of objects within %^H. This fixes using
    on_scope_end in blocks where string evals are compiled as those
    increment the refcount of objects in %^H on 5.10.
